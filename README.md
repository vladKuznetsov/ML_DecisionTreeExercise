# ML_exercise
This is a simple project to demonstrate intricacies of machine learning using simple data: 

1. Create a DecisionTree Model
2. Train it for different depths and display results
3. Apply PCA to this model to reduce dimentionality in input data
4. Train this model with cross-validation
4. Apply GridSearch mechanisn from scikit-learn to this model.
   grid search is done for touple (tree-depth, PCA redaction to given number of parameters, random initial state)
5. Results are presented on stdout and in a few graphs made with matplotlib
