# ML_exercise
simple project to learn all intricacies of machine learning using simple data 

It is a simple exercise in Machine Laerning

1. Create DecisionTree Model
2. Train it for different depths and display results
3. Apply PCA to this model
4. train this model with cross-validation
4. Apply GridSearch mechanisn from scikit-learn to this mode.
  grid search is done for touple (tree-depth, PCA  redaction to given number of parameters, random initial state )
5. results peresented on stdout and in few graphs made with matplotlib
